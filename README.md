GoogleMapsPlatformCombine
=======================

## Description
A Swift ilbrary containing Combine support, via `Publisher` and `Future`, for Google Maps Platform iOS SDKs.

## Example

### Example Usage

```swift
// Create a GMSMapViewPublisher
let publisher = GMSMapViewPublisher(mapView: mapView)

// Subscribe to events
publisher.didChangeCameraPosition.sink { cameraPosition in
  print("Camera position at \(cameraPosition.target)")
}
```

### Example Project

To run the example project:

1. Run `pod install` from the Example/ directory. 
2. Open the `GoogleMapsPlatformCombine.xcworkspace` file in Xcode

## Requirements
* Deployment Target of iOS 13.0+

## Installation

### [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

In your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'GoogleMapsPlatformCombine', '0.2.0'
```

Subspecs are also available if you only need Combine support for a specific SDK:

```ruby
# For Combine support for the Maps SDK for iOS only
pod 'GoogleMapsPlatformCombine/Maps', '0.2.0'

# For Combine support for the Places SDK for iOS only
pod 'GoogleMapsPlatformCombine/Places', '0.2.0'
```

### [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager)

Since the Maps/Places SDKs for iOS are not yet supported in SPM, if you install
this library via SPM you will need to also install Maps/Places using one of the
supported package managers. See installation options for [Maps][maps-install]
and [Places][places-install] for more information.
